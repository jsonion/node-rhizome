# jsonion-remap

Remapping JSON objects to a simplified, alternative schema is a breeze with **jsonion-remap** package. Instructions, defining how structure and in part content types are transformed, are coded in a JavaScript object with a slightly special syntax that resembles CSS, goes easy on you with the details and is simple to read and understand.

Among the features of this rather small package with zero dependencies are also type validation, conditional remapping rules, and the possibility to reuse preparsed instructions to process and transform multiple JavaScript objects in a row, without the additional overhead.

Feel free to file an issue or submit a pull request, should you find a use-case that requires implementing additional features.
